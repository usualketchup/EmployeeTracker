* The application has a `Queries.json` file that holds all queries and `Action.json` that has all functions and retrieves queries from respective file. The `app.json` renders all inquirer prompts and displays all results. The `Question.json` holds all choices for users. There are three i.e ,department , employee and role Classes being used by `controller.json` file. 

* There is a `allinfo.sql` file that SQL Workbench uses. This makes development of individual features much easier.

    * Inquirer
    * Console.table

    * Database
    

## Challenges:

* This activity was not very difficult at all because we did a number of similar activities in class and spent a lot of time using Inquirer, MySQL, and Node. Once I created the database and used MySQL Workbench to manage my database this worked out great!
